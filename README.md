Vintage Launcher is an easy-to-use mod loader for the indie survival game Vintage Story.
With it, you can run any configuration of mods and Vintage Story versions.

- Have distinct mod lists for playing single player or multiplayer, and switch between them with as little as two mouse-clicks.

For developers:

- Load your mod into Vintage Story with specific other mods for compatibility testing.
- Build identical profiles for multiple versions of Vintage Story for backwards compatibility testing.
- Quickly load different versions of your mod into different versions of Vintage Story
